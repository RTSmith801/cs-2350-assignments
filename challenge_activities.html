                <dd>This project involves two pages sharing the same HTML structure, a tribute to Ram Dass. The HTML remains consistent across both pages, while each section features unique CSS styling. In Layout 1, the focus is on a three-row structure, incorporating multiple columns in the body and a distinct aside section.</dd>

                <dd>This is the second segment of the dual-page project. While the HTML maintains uniformity across both pages, alterations to the CSS were implemented to impart a distinct visual identity to each page. Given the grid-based organization, repositioning elements proved challenging, prompting me to opt for enclosing the article within a scroll box to enhance compactness. Additionally, adjustments were made to font families and colors for a refined aesthetic.</dd>

                <dd>Employing a more flexible rendition of my usual weekly routine, this assignment centered on the creation and structuring of a table from the ground up. I discovered that, when dealing with an extensive table, meticulous planning of the entire schedule beforehand proves beneficial. Given that data entry occurs row by row, careful consideration is essential to accurately place each piece of information in its designated location.</dd>

                <dd>By clicking on this link, you'll be directed to the original design of this website. In its latest version, you'll notice dynamic elements have been incorporated, featuring rotation with a perspective effect that returns to center upon hovering. Additionally, I've experimented with linear gradients to create a reflective shine effect for these elements, alongside the introduction of background images and a revamped color scheme for the entire site.</dd>
